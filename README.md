Instagram clone is a cross platform application, built using Ionic Framework,  using languages HTML, SCSS and TypeScript.

It is actually a clone of instagram login page and all we need to do is use of social engineering in the best way and make user login on our device.

Social engineering is the art of manipulating people so they give up confidential information.

Hackers use social engineering tactics because it is usually easier to exploit your natural inclination to trust than it is to discover ways to hack your software.  For example, it is much easier to fool someone into giving you their password than it is for you to try hacking their password (unless the password is really weak).

Now the app is designed is such a way that whenever user will try to login into hackerâ€™s built fake instagram i.e on hackers device, then it will show network error and user will not be able to login.

Now, after successfully fetching user id and password, hacker can steal the credentials by entering his id and password and accessing local storage where id and password along with date and time were stored.

The data can be cleared by the hacker to remove  tracks and recommending patches.
